# my helper

Just a small repo to be included as a git submodule.

The package name can be the same as the repo name,
but here, they are distinguished in this case. The package name is `my_helper`.

A repo that becomes a git submodule or git subtree looks exactly the same as a repo on its own.

For simplicity, this repo has no docs folder.
